JDX
===

JDX stands for Java Dependency eXtractor. JDX is capable of extracting structural dependencies from source code written in Java. It works with plain source code, so there's no need for compiling anything. In fact, JDX works even if the input source code is not fully compilable. These features make it particularly suitable for Mining Software Repositories studies, where researches deal with plain source code checked out from version control systems (e.g., CVS, SVN, Git). JDX extracts the following kinds of dependencies: type imports, method imports, class inheritance, interface implementations, type references, method return type, method parameters, thrown types, type access, method calls, and interface inheritances.
